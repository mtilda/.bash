# .bash

My personal bash profile and tools

## Getting started

First, clone this repository in your home directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mtilda/.bash.git
```

To use this profile, `source ~/.bash/profile`.

You may want to configure your shell to do this automatically on login by adding the following script to either your `.profile`, `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, or another shell initialization file.

```bash
source $HOME/.bash/profile
```
